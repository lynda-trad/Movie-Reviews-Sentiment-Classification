# Movie Reviews Classification

This repository is composed of a dataset, a jupyter notebook and a README.

In the dataset, we can find movie reviews we can read on the website Imdb, along with their sentiment, meaning the feeling the review tries to convey.

Using Stochastic Gradient Descent, we will try and decipher whether a review is positive or negative.
